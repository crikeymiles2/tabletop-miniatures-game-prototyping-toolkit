## What is this?

As part of our [Rule Of Carnage podcast](https://ruleofcarnage.com), and in preparation of our book [_The Fundamentals of Tabletop Miniatures Game Design_](https://planetsmashergames.com/fundamentals), we have examined a wide body of non-discrete miniatures game systems. Throughout our book we analyse and itemise the common features shared by most tabletop miniatures game rules systems, and the prevailing design conventions used by designers in implementing those features. We discuss the hypothetical implementations of these features at length, comparing the strengths and weaknesses of various approaches, and drawn on examples from published games to illustrate the patterns. patterns are apparent to us.

Moving from the hypothetical to the concrete, and as a companion to the book, we have created a tabletop miniatures game prototyping toolkit as an online tool. This toolkit contains generic implementations of many of the rules features discussed in this book, and provides a small array of options for each, in order to illustrate some of the possible approaches. You can generate a new miniatures game in moments by using our online tool:

The toolkit is provided partly as a rapid prototyping tool, allowing you to generate the skeleton of a tabletop miniatures game in moments. It also exists to make the point that if a design simply reorganises common mechanical tropes into a new order, it is unlikely to be an effective design. Effective game design tightly integrates its core ideas with mechanics to shape the players' experiences. This toolkit doesnâ€™t create interesting games, it creates functional ones. It can be used as a starting point or as an inspiration.
